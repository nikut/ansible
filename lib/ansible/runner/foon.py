    What is Foon?
    A Foon is another name for a Spork, which is a Fork plus a Spoon
    this class is a wrapper around multiprocessing in Python
    which deals with parallelism via Forks. 
    there is no Spoon.

    Two things we do differently over stock multiprocessing:
       * intercept exceptions
       * duplicate stdin per host to enable the process to ask questions about host key checking

    That's it.  This class is specific to Ansible's runner forking and is not meant to be generic.
